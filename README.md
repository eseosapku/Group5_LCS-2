This Readme file explains the following tasks we chose:
1) a shell script that will print the strings “one”,” two”,” three”,” four”, and “five” on the screen with each appearing on a separate line. As well as a text file that has each of these on a separate line and the file name starts with today's date “yyyy-mm-dd-file.txt”. 
3) a shell script that asks the user to type a phrase, then tells the user the number of words in the phrase and the number of white spaces.
4a) a shell script that asks the user for two numbers and outputs their products. 
4b) a text file with at least 4 words(folder name on each line). A shell script that reads each line of the text file. Then creates a corresponding folder for each folder name.
